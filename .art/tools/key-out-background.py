"""Cut a flat chroma-key background out of a generated sprite.

`image_gen` on this machine does not return an alpha channel — it paints an
opaque background, and asked for transparency it draws a checkerboard into the
pixels. Asking it for one flat key colour instead gives something that can be
removed exactly, which a drawn checkerboard cannot.

Every key-coloured pixel is removed, wherever it sits — the gaps between the
staff, the arm and the body are enclosed by the subject and have to go too, so
a border flood fill leaves green blobs inside the silhouette. That only works
because the key colour appears nowhere on the subject; green is safe for this
character, whose brown hair, blue cloak, grey robe, skin and gold are all red-
or blue-dominant. The run reports how much it removed away from the border, so
a key tint landing on the subject shows up as a number instead of a hole.

The character's own colours are left alone. Only the boundary pixels get a
partial alpha and have the key colour divided back out, which is where the
fringe would otherwise be.
