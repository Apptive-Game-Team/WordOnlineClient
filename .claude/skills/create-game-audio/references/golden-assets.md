| Approval date | 2026-07-27 |
| Model/version | ElevenLabs Eleven Music `music_v2`, `force_instrumental: true`, 30000 ms |
| MCP constraint | elevenlabs MCP disconnected; generated via direct REST `POST /v1/music`. The Music API exposes no `prompt_influence` and no `looping` field — both recorded as design targets only, neither applied |
| Processing chain | mp3_44100_128 → mono → peak normalize -6 dBFS → PCM_16 44.1 kHz WAV. **No leading-silence strip, no tail fade** (the one-shot chain in `postprocess_candidate.py` would destroy the loop) |

Prompt:

```text
Very quiet miniature wooden marimba round for a handcrafted pop-up-book diorama menu.
A single small marimba played with soft felt mallets, close-miked, dry small room, no
reverb wash. A three-note motif enters, and a second voice answers the same motif a bar
later in canon. Long rests between phrases; more silence than notes. Very slow, about
60 BPM, low dynamic level, no crescendo, no build, no drums, no bass line. Seamless loop:
the last bar leads back into the first with no ending gesture. No vocals, no synth pad,
no strings, no chime, no bell, no glass, no sparkle, no cinematic swell, no orchestra.
```

## MagicBook BGM — Wooden Music Box

| Field | Value |

Prompt:

```text
Extremely sparse wooden music box texture for a quiet paper library inside a handcrafted
pop-up-book diorama. A small kalimba and a low wooden marimba trade two-note figures,
soft felt mallets, close-miked, dry small room. Slightly lower register and even sparser
than a menu theme; long silences between figures. About 52 BPM, very low dynamic level,
no build, no drums, no bass line. Seamless loop with no ending gesture. No vocals, no
synth pad, no strings, no chime, no bell, no glass, no sparkle, no cinematic swell,
no orchestra.
```

Both files are bit-identical to the approved audition WAVs (hash unchanged by the copy
into `Assets/`), so no renewed approval was required. Do not re-normalize or resample
them; set playback level on the AudioSource.

## Fire Attack Release

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Family | `magic-fire` |
| Event | Fire served-object attack release |
| Production asset | Pending canonical WAV; provisional runtime MP3 removed |
| Approved source | `.sfx-work/issue-377/review-candidates/FireReleaseBatch02/fire_flare_candidate_04.mp3` |
| Duration | 0.85 seconds requested |
| Format | Stereo MP3, 44.1 kHz, 128 kbps |
| Looping | Off |
| Prompt influence | 0.80 design target; unavailable in the connected MCP |
| Model/version | ElevenLabs Sound Effects model/version not exposed by the MCP |
| Generation date | 2026-07-23 |
| Processing chain | Direct MCP output copied byte-for-byte; no processing before source approval |
| SHA-256 | `9b0f75d18fc0083e98c7b6b87f444818e881a1394764163c4845686649712fc7` |
| Approved by | User listening pass |
| Approval date | 2026-07-23 |
| Isolated result | Candidate 4 selected; preferred small natural flare |
| Unity/WebGL result | Pending |
| Provider/provenance | ElevenLabs Sound Effects under project account |
| Distribution license | Project-owner eligibility verification pending |
| Final conversion | Pending PCM WAV 16-bit, 44.1 kHz, mono; new hash requires renewed approval |
| Rejected candidates | Batch 01 candidates 01–04 and Batch 02 candidates 01–03 |
| Rejection summary | Too metallic/impact-like or explosive; candidate 4 had the clearest small natural “화르륵” flare |

Prompt:

```text
A small sheet of natural flame rapidly catching and fluttering across dry kindling
in an open forest clearing, heard close from a third-person player perspective,
One-shot, realistic dry fire Foley.
Sequence: faint air breath, quick soft flare-up, lively flame flutter, short airy fade.
Light combustion only. No explosion, blast, impact, bass thump, pressure boom, metal,
bell, chime, glass, tonal ping, synth, or cartoon sound.
```

Use this clip only for the Fire attack event. Do not reuse it for spawn, hit, or
death. The earlier `fire_accent.wav` layering is not approved under the revised
realistic direction; each later Fire lifecycle event requires its own complete
listening-approved clip.

## UI Wood Button Click

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Family | `ui-wood` |
| Event | standard button click (all `ButtonBase` + global fallback) |
| Production asset | `Assets/Resources/Sound/UI/wood_button_click_v4.wav` |
| Approved source | `.sfx-work/issue-377/ui-wood/button/ui_wood_button_b3_g_20260723_proc.wav` |
| Duration | 0.22 seconds |
| Format | Mono PCM WAV, 44.1 kHz, 16-bit, peak -3 dBFS |
| Looping | Off |
| SHA-256 | `3259e5ec38bad65492fb3351b52dba3b2407839070204f33ab505f6e24db380e` |
| Approved by | User listening pass (batch presented as 4 files; user picked the 4th) |
| Approval date | 2026-07-23 |
| Generation | ElevenLabs `POST /v1/sound-generation`, `duration_seconds: 0.5`, `prompt_influence: 0.75` |
| Post-processing | `postprocess_candidate.py --peak -3 --target-duration 0.22` |
| Unity/WebGL result | Pending |
| Rejected candidates | b3_b, b3_d, b3_e (user: all similar); b3_a/c/f + batch 2 entire (auto-reject: source peak below -20 dBFS) |

Prompt (450-char limit applies to the API):

```text
A dense hardwood button pressed firmly by a fingertip on a wooden game board,
dry close studio, extreme close-up, One-shot, crisp clean Foley at strong
professional recording level. Temporal sequence: fingertip contact -> one
short solid wooden knock -> clean dry decay to silence. No plastic tick, no
toy, no cartoon pop, no desk mouse, no metal, no bell, no chime, no glass,
no reverb, no quiet distant recording.
```

Lesson: level-suppressing words ("soft", "restrained") make the model output
near-silence (peaks -35 to -47 dBFS, unusable SNR). Demand strong recording
level in the prompt and shape softness in post instead.

## Card Paper Family (hover / select / deselect)

| Field | hover | select | deselect |
|---|---|---|---|
| Production asset | `Sound/Game/Card/card_hover_v1.wav` | `Sound/Game/Card/card_select_v1.wav` | `Sound/Game/Card/card_deselect_v1.wav` |
| Approved source | `card_hover_b_20260723_proc.wav` | `card_select_d_20260723_proc.wav` | `card_deselect_c_20260723_proc.wav` |
| Duration / peak | 0.14 s / -12 dBFS | 0.18 s / -3 dBFS | 0.16 s / -6 dBFS |
| SHA-256 | `1d8c9e51…afcb` | `30e9de16…9cc8` | `8272d3a6…0456` |
| Selection | measurement-based (user-delegated), 2026-07-23 | same | same |

Family: `card-paper`. Generation: direct API, 0.5 s, influence 0.75,
postprocess trim per event. Hover must stay clearly quieter than select
(enforced by per-event `--peak`).

Prompts: coated paper card + felt-covered wooden table; hover = light
fingertip brush; select = firm tap and place; deselect = lift off felt.
All end with "at strong professional recording level" (quiet-output lesson)
and the standard exclusions (no coin, glass, metal, bell, sparkle, reverb).

## Field Confirm

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Family | `field-ground` |
| Production asset | `Sound/Game/field_confirm_v2.wav` |
| Approved source | `field_confirm_d_20260723_proc.wav` |
| Duration / peak | 0.18 s / -6 dBFS |
| SHA-256 | `ce7776a6c1ec43a49c77ed1964c3e36837a0f6cc26e369fa0844dc5d5e414dc6` |
| Selection | measurement-based (user-delegated), 2026-07-23; a/b/c auto-rejected (quiet) |

Prompt: fingertip tapping once on short dry grass over firm soil on a
miniature game board; exclusions include footstep, digging, wood knock.

## Fire / Stone Lifecycle Sets (vertical slice)

| Event | Production asset | Duration / peak | SHA-256 (short) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Fire spawn | `Sound/Game/Fire/fire_spawn_v1.wav` | 0.80 s / -4 dBFS | `27a628e7…a9b2` |
| Fire hit | `Sound/Game/Fire/fire_hit_v1.wav` | 0.35 s / -4 dBFS | `b7c20072…865b` |
| Fire death | `Sound/Game/Fire/fire_death_v1.wav` | 1.10 s / -4 dBFS | `2e77064b…2a41` |
| Stone spawn | `Sound/Game/Stone/stone_spawn_v1.wav` | 0.75 s / -4 dBFS | `a162cb94…5c1d` |
| Stone hit | `Sound/Game/Stone/stone_hit_v1.wav` | 0.35 s / -4 dBFS | `4c19eba5…08ac` |
| Stone death | `Sound/Game/Stone/stone_death_v1.wav` | 1.20 s / -4 dBFS | `069d08fd…56ec` |

Families `creature-fire` / `building-stone`. Selection measurement-based
(user-delegated), 2026-07-23. Full hashes and batch stats in the asset
manifest. Prompt grammar: spawn = paper pop-up unfold + material arrival;
death = prop collapse into component material (ember extinguish / pebble
spill). Assign to FireCreature / StoneBuilding profile slots in Unity;
fire attack anchor is `Sound/Game/Fire/fire_attack_v1.wav`.

## Shared Attack / Impact Slots (2026-08-03)

The 2026-07-27 concept doc replaced seven per-element attack sounds with
three shared buckets. Elements survive only in spawn sounds; attacks and
impacts are shared because they fire several times per second and any
character in them becomes noise.

| Slot | Approved source | Duration / peak | SHA-256 (short) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Melee attack (all creatures) | `object-melee/attack/candidate_07_20260803_proc.wav` | 0.25 s / -10 dBFS | `ccc24e16…3552` |
| Ranged attack (creatures + buildings) | `transient_release_02` (approved earlier) | — | see earlier entry |
| Explosion (all projectiles/spells) | `object-explosion/impact/r2_twolayer_b_20260803_proc.wav` | 0.45 s / -6 dBFS | `5af69fa2…a84a` |
| Card hover (rework) | `ui-card/hover/candidate_02_20260803_proc.wav` | 0.12 s / -16 dBFS | `c1a005fa…beba` |

Levels are baked to the concept doc's hierarchy (explosion -6 > ranged -9 >
melee -10 > hover -16), not the usual `--peak -3`, so relative loudness is
already correct before profile volumes are touched.

Prompt grammar that worked: wood and paper on felt, stated as a time
sequence, with an explicit ban on ringing. What failed: dry soil and pebbles
(rings bright on felt no matter the wording), and generating a whole batch
from a single prompt — vary the material concept, not the take.
