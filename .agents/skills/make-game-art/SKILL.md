# Make Game Art

Create game art from one shared rendering system. Separate rendering technique
from faction shape language. Never let each faction drift into a different
drawing style.

## Sources of truth

Read these before generating or editing art:

1. `.art/WORLD.md` — confirmed lore; do not invent missing canon.
2. `.art/STYLE.md` — canonical rendering technique, faction language, palette,
   and current master-style decision.
3. `.art/ANCHORS.md` — frozen production anchors and exclusions.
4. `.art/CONCEPT-BRIEF.md` — active explorations and comparison Site.
5. `.art/ANIMATION-ASSETS.md` — semantic frame names, pivot invariants, and aura behavior.
6. `.art/PRODUCTION-STATUS.md` — completed replacements and the next eligible targets.

Check `PRODUCTION-STATUS.md` before proposing a target. Do not propose an asset
marked complete unless the user explicitly asks to revisit it or a concrete defect
first changes its status to `재작업 필요`. Update the status in the same change that
ships a replacement.

Precedence:

1. User's explicit decision in the current task.
2. Selected master-style anchor recorded in `.art/STYLE.md`.
3. Faction-specific shape and palette rules.
4. Legacy art, used for subject identity only.

Once a master style is selected, do not use legacy faction images as rendering
references. They may describe *what* exists, never *how* to draw it.

## Classify the task

### Production art

Use when adding or revising an asset without changing the art direction.

- Load the selected master-style image as the primary image reference.
- Apply the target faction's shape language and palette from `.art/STYLE.md`.
- Keep camera, lighting, proportions, edge treatment, detail density, facial
  grammar, and shadow treatment identical to the master.
- Generate concepts outside `Assets/`.
- Move only approved, game-ready assets into Unity paths.

### Style-defining art

Use when an image could become a new reference for future assets, or when the
user asks to change drawing style, rendering, proportions, lighting, palette
system, camera, facial grammar, or material treatment.

1. Treat the result as a proposal, not a canonical anchor.
2. Keep subjects and composition fixed; generate 2–4 style candidates that vary
   only the questioned rendering axis.
3. Save candidates under `.art/concept/`.
4. Publish them to the comparison Site recorded in `.art/CONCEPT-BRIEF.md`.
5. Stop canonicalization until the user selects or explicitly approves one.
6. After approval:
   - record the winning file and reason in `.art/STYLE.md`;
   - update shared rendering rules to describe the visible result;
   - promote a frozen copy to `.art/anchors/master-v2/`;
   - update `.art/ANCHORS.md` and `.art/CONCEPT-BRIEF.md`;
   - identify which existing assets now violate the new standard;
   - regenerate downstream faction boards using only the new master reference.

Never silently change style because one generated output looks better.

### Concept exploration

Use for lore, silhouettes, roles, faction lineups, or composition exploration.
Concept boards help decide *what* to draw. They are not production anchors.
Do not feed a multi-subject board or scene directly into sprite generation
unless it is explicitly the selected master-style key.

## Generation workflow

1. Confirm asset role: production, style-defining, or exploration.
2. Confirm subject, faction, game use, tier, and output path.
3. Read the sources of truth.
4. Inspect the selected master reference.
5. Build a prompt that explicitly locks:
   - rendering technique;
   - camera and facing;
   - proportions and silhouette;
   - shared light and shadow;
   - edge and detail density;
   - faction shape language and palette;
   - required exclusions.
6. Use the `imagegen` skill for bitmap generation or editing.
7. Save exploratory output under `.art/concept/`.
8. Compare all candidates at thumbnail size through the project Site and
   `./.art/make-sheets.sh`.
9. Use the `magick` skill for resize, trim, alpha, format, and dimension checks.
10. Move an asset into `Assets/` only after approval.

## Production sprite rules

- Single subject; centered; right-facing unless gameplay needs otherwise.
- Transparent background.
- No text, frame, card mockup, scene, or watermark.
- Preserve aspect ratio and trim transparent padding.
- Maximum size: small `128x128`, middle `192x192`, big `256x256`.
- Silhouette must survive at `64px`.
- Keep the server-derived filename unchanged when `resourceName` depends on it.
- Preserve or create Unity `.meta` through normal import.
- Before treating `<Name>2.png` as another creature, inspect its prefab. It may
  be an attack frame wired to `OnAttackSpriteSwapper`.
- Paired frames must share PPU, Bottom Center pivot, body scale, ground contact,
  camera, and facing. Name them by meaning in docs: base pose / attack pose.
  Finalize a pair with **one shared crop box and one shared scale factor**, taken
  from the union of both frames' alpha bounding boxes, so ground contact matches
  by construction. Trimming each frame on its own is what left `TreeGolem` and
  `TreeGolem2` at different PPU. Confirm afterwards that both files report the
  same canvas size and the same gap between the subject's bottom and the canvas
  bottom.
- Ask a generator for the attack frame in a **separate** call, with the approved
  base frame attached and an instruction to move only the named limb. Asking for
  both frames at once returns two unrelated poses.
- Generate idle/attack aura as separate transparent assets. Do not bake aura
  into the creature sprite.
- Treat `CloudDragon`'s spherical `cloud.png` as a dedicated water aura. Do not
  derive it from or replace it with the shared wind aura.

Typical finalization:

```bash
magick input.png -resize 256x256 -trim +repage output.png
magick identify output.png
```

## Validation

- Compare the new asset beside the master-style key and at least one asset from
  every affected faction, not only its nearest relative.
- Reject visible changes in renderer, camera, eye style, edge softness,
  highlight shape, shadow shape, or detail density.
- Run `./.art/make-sheets.sh`.
- Verify dimensions, trim, filename, and Unity path.
- Verify the cutout as described below. Generators hand back a painted
  background often enough that this is not optional.
- Keep rejected generations out of `.art/anchors/master-v2/` and `Assets/`.
- Record any approved style change before generating dependent assets.

### Verifying the cutout

`alpha.getextrema()[0] == 0` does **not** prove a sprite is cut out. One
transparent pixel anywhere passes it, so a subject sitting on a painted white
rectangle, or a canvas filled with a painted grey-and-white checkerboard, sails
through. Both have shipped that way. Check three things instead:

- **All four corner pixels have alpha 0.** A painted background usually reaches
  the corners.
- **A sane share of the canvas is transparent.** Roughly a fifth or more around a
  single subject. A tiling strip is different: it must bleed off its left and
  right edges, so expect clear space only above and below.
- **No large block of bright desaturated pixels.** The palettes in `STYLE.md` are
  greens, browns, stone and hot orange. Nothing in this art is both bright and
  near-grey, so a big share of such pixels is a background that was drawn rather
  than cut. Over about 5% of the opaque pixels is a reject.

Then look at it. Composite the sprite over magenta and view it — a painted
background is instantly obvious and no numeric test replaces the glance.

When the check fails, regenerate with the transparent-background option. Do not
chroma-key the background away: keying leaves a pale fringe, and it hides the
fact that the generator is ignoring the instruction. Post-processing is a
last resort when regeneration is genuinely unavailable, and it must be called out
in the pull request as art to be redone.

## Boundaries

- Do not edit `.art/anchors/master-v2/` in place. Propose a new versioned
  master set deliberately.
- Do not move `.art/` under `Assets/`.
- Do not overwrite shipped art before user approval.
- Do not infer lore absent from `.art/WORLD.md`; mark it exploratory.
- Do not mix unrelated working-tree changes into the art change.
